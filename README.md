# ScintillatiNG

**ScintillatiNG** is an Angualr web application that I was hoping would use browser notifications but that feature is being tabled for the moment.

What it does featuere:

* Leaflet maps
* OpenWeatherMap for data
* PostgreSQL database
* A means to do geocoding
* A proper set of instructions for how to develop applications in Angular.

## But Jason, those don't sound like features!

They are when you consider the instructions were were given on how to develop an Angular app did not consider how if you wanted to use Node modules written in Javascript, you need to use a `@types` package.
Futhermore, there was no gudance on how to use Leaflet or PostgreSQL (which haas features for GIS) that employers are interested in.
This app also corrects the linting process which no longer uses TSLint (which Angular still generates by default). Instead, ESLint has been set up with plugins to properly work with TypeScript and Angular.

With this many changes, ther is now a [**wiki**](https://github.com/jrcharney/ScintillatiNG/wiki).

Also included with this project are better instructions for using branches, espeically GitHub Pages like [the pages for this project](https://jrcharney.github.io/ScintillatiNG).
I'm making a better project for everyone to learn and develop from.

Less geekspeak, more doing!

So let's get this project done right this time!


This application is also being developed on Vim not VSCode.
