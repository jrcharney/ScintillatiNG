			<h2>About ScintillatiNG</h2>
			<p><b>ScintillatiNG</b> is my <i>fourth</i> attempt at getting my LaunchCode Liftoff project completed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. Not everyone has a good idea on the first try.</p>
			<p>In this attempt, I will take better use of GitHub's features including the <a href="https://github.com/jrcharney/ScintillatiNG/wiki/">Wiki</a> and the new <a href="https://github.com/jrcharney/ScintillatiNG/projects/1">Projects</a> for Kanban. Basically migrating some of the items over from the Trello board I have been using.</p>
			<p>I'm including a Wiki because while trying to figure out how to complete the <a href="https://jrcharney.github.io/LightniNG">first</a> <a href="https://jrcharney.github.io/cloudburst">three</a> <a href="https://jrcharney.github.io/Blitz">attempts</a>, I had made notes that will provide an excellent resource for the next project (which won't be another attempt at this one.)</p>
			<p>I'm getting it right this time. And even if this attempt fails (which it shouldn't), there will be a valuable resource that will be available and constantly updated.</p>

			<h2>Dealine: November 11, 2020</h2>
			<p class="date">November 1, 2020</p>
			<p>The chaos that has happened outside had defintely contributed to the diffcultly with completing this assignment on time. Normally this doesn't happen. Elections are elections, and I do my part to get out and vote and to encourage others to vote.</p>
			<p>But this time it is personal. The person we call "president" has attacked science constantly even in a time where he should be helping scientists cure a pandemic, lessen climate change, resolve environmental problems that ultimately have an effect on the economy and sociopolitical issues.</p>
			<p>Even after this election, efforts will be commited to make sure that over the next 80 days, a loss doesn't turn into demegoguery.</p>
			<p>I really did not want this to be a project that describes politics, but politics has interfered with science so much these past few years, it's time to stand up and fight back.</p>
			<p>Every time the goverment shuts down, the federal goverment's scientific resources are shut down.  Every time there is a disaster, THERE'S ALWAYS A TWEET where any other leader regardless of party would have provided disaster assitance to those suffering. This one refused to help people whose homes were destroyed because of wildfire, hurricanes, earthquakes, flooding, all because "they didn't vote for me".</p>
			<p>No elected leader should ever use his power to punish the electorate for chosing to elect someone else. That is the behavior of dictators.</p>
			<p>Some people are willing to vote for him anyway because they have seen dictators in primarly far-left goverments who have besmerched the benefits of socialism in order to preserve political power. This is a problem that is not limited to communist of socialist nations. It happens under fascism and nationalism as well.  The worse case it when it happens under a democracy or a republic.  The United States has suffered thusly under this third case, in which it is up to the people to end it.</p>
			<p>There is nothing anti-American about socialism as the meaning of socialism is that the government provides aid to those who need it. It does not imply that the goverment has a goosestep authority to do whatever they like.</p>
			<p>All governments look good on paper, but it is the people who implement them and are closes to the rules that they abuse who corrupt goverment for their own benefit rather than to the benefit of the people whose needs should be put ahead of the leaders of the government, or those leaders inner circle or friends or colleges or even families.</p>
			<p>For democracy to surivive in the 21st Century, Nepotism, Oligarchy, Kleptcracy, even Evangelical Fascism all must be routed out!</p>
			<p>This is what democracy needs. Not necessarily term limits but a review of who is running, a background check, as well as review as to whether or not they are mentally fit to run for office. Unfortuantely, our democracy has been infiltrated by people who believe in farfetched conspiracies that haven't so much as an iota of truth such as Birtherism and the insane belief that a pizza parlor hosts a blood cult in its basement despite the fact that said pizza parlor has no basement.</p>
			<p>Our democracy requires people who do not pedal fraud on a regular basis. There is no room for such chaotic and abusive behavior at any level of government, and those who do bring it should expect their political careers to be very short.</p>
			<p>So here's to hoping the majority of America does the right thing. We need them to do the right thing, and take every election seriously. 230,000 Americans are dead because of such neclectful leadership, because a small group of people put their party before their citizens. By comparison, fewer people have died in combat in the American Civil War (218,222) over a period of four years than who have died in the last nine months. (Source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_of_war">Wikipedia</a>.). And by the end of the year, that could eclipse the combat death toll in World War II.</p>
			<p><b>So it is up to us, America!</b></p>
			<p>Between Election Day and Inaugeration Day, there is another date you should mark on you calendar: December 14, 2020. This is the day the electors of the electoral college will confirm their decision as to who becomes the next president. The popular vote may say who we want to be president, but a small group of people willing to put party before the people will likely let chaos ensue. It's important you know who those people are and to tell them what is at stake in this country.</p>
